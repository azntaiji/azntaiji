👋 Hi, I’m Zach Taiji.

📣 I'm currently a graphic designer, web designer, and social listening analyst for a boutique marketing agency that works primarily with pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and healthcare non-profits.

Previously, I spent over a decade working in digital PR and social media marketing, serving technology companies of all sizes across the cybersecurity, space, blockchain, artificial intelligence, fintech, and cloud computing verticals.

With the majority of my professional experience spent in fast-paced agency settings and the occasional freelance project, the skills I've acquired are largely self-taught. I also have a strong desire to understand and learn complex systems, processes, and technologies, which I partially attribute to my neurodivergent brain.
